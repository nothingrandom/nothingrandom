## Hey there, I'm Benjamin Hollway aka [nothingrandom](https://nothingrandom.com) üëãüèª

I'm Benjamin, a lead javascript / frontend engineer, based on the road.

Mostly working with React/Vue.js, with a mix of the latest ES/ECMA spec, TypeScript, S/CSS, and a sprinkle of magic.

During my downtime, there's few things better than playing fetch with my border collie, [Nova](https://www.instagram.com/thebcsupernova/). And sometimes cycling to new locations to take pictures in new places. My wife, [Indy](https://instagram.com/indy_hollway), and I love to take as much time as possible to explore hidden beaches, hike in the mountain, and discover trails off the beaten path.

I believe food is the heart of every home, and so keep a small [food and recipe blog](/food). I'd love to open my own cafe one day, but currently I'm sticking to discovering local favourites.
