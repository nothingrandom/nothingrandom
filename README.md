## Hey there, I'm Benjamin Grant or Be - [nothingrandom](https://b.nothingrandom.studio) üëãüèª

I'm Benjamin, a lead javascript / frontend engineer, based in Brighton.

Mostly working with Typescript, React/Vue.js, with a mix of the latest ES/ECMA spec, S/CSS. I'm currently focusing on browser extensions, with a strong knowledge of native APIs and the innards of a browser.

During my downtime, there's few things better than playing fetch with my border collie, [Nova](https://www.instagram.com/thebcsupernova/). My wife, [Indy](https://instagram.com/indiazoeann), and I love to take as much time as possible driving to explore hidden beaches, hike in the mountains, and discover trails off the beaten path.

I believe food is the heart of every home, and so keep a small [food and recipe blog](https://b.nothingrandom.studio/food). I'd love to open my own cafe one day, but currently I'm sticking to discovering local favourites.
